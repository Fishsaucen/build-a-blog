- index.html needs to work regardless if there are no posts
- instead of redirecting the user to /blog/newpost when the db is empty, create
  'getting started' entry and display that. delete 'getting started' once a new post
  has been entered.
- apply styles to '/blog/post_id', currently styles are not used when viewing a post
  after following the link to it's id.
